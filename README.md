# 🚀 ExcessScheme  
### Decentralized Tokenized Welfare & Donation Distribution Platform  
**Hackathon Track:** Open Innovation – Algorand  
**Team Name:** IMAGINARY_CODER

## 🌍 Overview

ExcessScheme is a decentralized mediator platform built on the **Algorand Blockchain** to tokenize, distribute, and track government schemes, scholarships, and NGO donations.

The platform eliminates corruption, reduces fund leakage, prevents ghost beneficiaries, and detects money mule fraud using AI/ML-driven blockchain analysis.

Instead of directly distributing fiat money, funds are converted into blockchain tokens and governed by smart contracts deployed using AlgoKit.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional welfare distribution systems suffer from:

- Fund leakage and corruption  
- Fake beneficiaries  
- Lack of transparency  
- Delayed manual verification  
- Money mule fraud  

Centralized systems lack accountability and real-time audit capability.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

ExcessScheme transforms welfare distribution into a programmable, transparent, and secure blockchain-based system.

### Core Concept:
1. Convert scheme funds into Algorand tokens.
2. Distribute tokens via smart contracts.
3. Track every transaction transparently.
4. Detect suspicious fund movement using AI/ML.

# 🏗️ Architecture

The platform operates in two primary layers:

---

## 🏛️ 1. Fund Provider Layer  
(Government / NGOs / Private Organizations)

### Step 1: Fund Deposit  
Organizations deposit scheme funds into the platform.

### Step 2: Tokenization  
Funds are converted into **Algorand Standard Assets (ASA)**.

Each scheme gets its own token:
- ScholarshipToken  
- DonationToken  
- ReliefToken  

### Step 3: Smart Contract Governance (AlgoKit)

Smart contracts define:

- Eligibility rules  
- Distribution logic  
- Vesting conditions  
- Redemption restrictions  
- Fraud triggers  

All logic is automated and tamper-proof.

---

### 🔹 Scholarship Tokenization API (Innovation Module)

A dedicated API module allows:

- Dynamic creation of new scheme tokens  
- Automatic smart contract configuration  
- Liquidity and redemption control  
- Secure scheme deployment  

This enables scalable welfare tokenization.

---

## 👩‍🎓 2. Beneficiary Layer  
(Schools / Students / Public Users)

### Identity Verification

Users register and verify using:

- Aadhaar  
- PAN  

After KYC verification, user identity metadata is securely linked to blockchain records.

---

### Token Distribution

Once approved:

- Tokens are transferred to beneficiary wallets  
- Transactions are recorded immutably on Algorand  
- Full transparency is maintained  

No manual interference.

---

# 🔍 AI-Based Money Mule Detection

Money mule fraud occurs when multiple beneficiaries redirect funds to a single suspicious wallet.

Because Algorand provides a transparent public ledger, our system:

- Builds transaction graphs  
- Detects abnormal clustering  
- Identifies repetitive fund redirection  
- Flags suspicious wallets  

If unusual patterns are detected:

- Tokens can be flagged  
- Wallet access can be restricted  
- Alerts are triggered for review  

This creates proactive fraud prevention.
